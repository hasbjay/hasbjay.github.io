    <p>As you can see, I'm not the best designer in the world (keep that in mind). </p>

    <h2>Here's a brief bio about me</h2>
    <p>My name is Hasmieu Jalloh (pronounced Has-Me-You) but I'm not your AVERAGE guy, that's a TYPICAL saying I would agree. If you didn't 
        laugh you are a MEAN one. 
    I spent about the first ten (10) years of my life in Liberia where I developed my love for electronics and would supply electricity to my house and a neighbouring house
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.5em; padding: 1em;">I later moved to Sierra Leone and was hornored to be raised by different relatives and I learnt to read and memorize the Holy Qur'an there (a portion of the Qur'an, I still read it for understanding rather than memorization).
       I attented Junior Secondary School (JSS) to Senior Secondary School (SSS) in Sierra Leone until I moved to the United States where I ended up repeating three grades anyway. Thank God my genes compensated my age (people always thought I was younger than my actual age).
       I developed love for computer programming around 15 (But I think I started early on with electronics, that was my programming).
       Most people say that I speak softly and I'm calm, here's the truth, I stutter. Inorder to go a day (in school) without getting bully for my stutter, I started speaking slowly and calmly,
       I stopped mingling all together. So I developed love for books and learning quietly (but at a rapid speed), I just can't communicate my ideas because I stutter-I try to speak now though, but with a severe stutter- 
       Stuttering (at least for me) is a blessing, there were times when I wanted to say some wild stuffs and words that I wouldn't be able to take back, but I just couldn't speak. Thanks Stutter (this isn't sarcasm).
       I will be entering college this year (2024), and I'm eighteen (18) years old. Yep (remember I said I repeated three whole grades?), well I would have been a junior in college at eighteen (18) if I hadn't repeated those grades.

    <h2>Reaching Me</h2>
    <p>
        I rarely respond to messages (I read all of them though), I check my email most often than my other social platforms.
