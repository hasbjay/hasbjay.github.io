    <div class="lessons to_center">
        <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
        <p>From my first Qur'anic teacher,<br>
        that I never meddle with the affairs of others,<br>
    and that I never speak evil or ill of anyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lessons to_center">
        <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
        <p>From my personal expereince and that of others,<br>
        that I shouldn't be satisfied with just the gist of important topics,<br>
    but that I dig more into them for better understanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lessons to_center">
        <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
        <p>From my observations of my father,<br>
        that personal life should be kept private, and what's meant <br>
    to be public shold not be kept from the public <br>
    nor alter in any shape or from. <br>
    And that I be modest in my actions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="lessons to_center">
        <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
        <p>
            I'm grateful to God that He made me the way he did,<br>
            and that He granted me certain traits that He grants only to a few.<br>
            One of the traits I'm especially thankful for is my urgent sense of fear
            of ridiculing others, <br>
            for I don't have the courage to look down on even an army of ants.<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lessons to_center">
        <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
        <p>Lesson 5<br>
        To God, for the kind of parents he gave me to,<br>
        and that they always do their best to not only provide for my siblings and I, <br>
        but also that they educate us by both words and examples.
